# ISSUES
Sound block doesnt play any sound.

## USAGE
python midi2json.py <input.mid> <output.json>

# Requirements
mido 
```pip install mido```

# How to Use
Clone the github repository.

Open up a terminal in the directory of the python script.

Run ```python midi2json.py <input.mid> <output.json>```

It will export a json file, go to the index json editor.
Press open, and then json file.
Open the json file and save it as a level file.

Put it in your levels and open it!

You will then have to make a block animated that goes through all the triggers **MUST BE STRAIGHT!**
Make the time of the animation the time of the midi you exported.
and boom, you have your song!
